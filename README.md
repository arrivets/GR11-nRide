This project is intended as a submission to 
[NKN's open innovation Gitcoin grant](https://gitcoin.co/issue/nknorg/nBounty/8/100026451),
and welcomes new contributors. 

## Getting Started

This project is built with Flutter.

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Roadmap

The following is a high level roadmap of what we would like to achieve as part
of the [hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/issue/nknorg/nBounty/8/100026451), but is
obviously not complete for a production app.

- [ ] Android
    - [x] Display a map with current location
    - [ ] Create/Join NKN pub/sub group corresponding to geographical area
    - [ ] Display positions of other users in the same area
    - [ ] Different UI for riders and passengers. 
          Rider broadcasts 'availability'; passengers display available riders
    - [ ] Passengers send 'request' to available riders
    - [ ] Riders automatically send a 'response'
    - [ ] Passenger selects 'best' response and establishes 1-1 communication
          with selected rider
    - [ ] Realtime position updates between passenger and rider
- [ ] iOS
